## 📌 About the Project

The goal of this project was to:
- Study a **modern fashion website layout**
- Recreate the UI using **HTML and CSS Grid**
- Apply my **own understanding of layout, alignment, and styling**
- Improve the design by making it **responsive for mobile devices**

This is **not a 1:1 copy**.  
I recreated the structure as closely as possible while **implementing my own logic, fixes, and improvements**, especially for responsiveness.

Through this project, I practiced:
