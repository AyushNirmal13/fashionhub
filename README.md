## 📌 About the Project

This project was built as a **learning-focused frontend exercise**.  
The primary objective was to study a modern fashion landing page design and recreate it using core web technologies.

- The **visual concept and content** are inspired by the original Dribbble design.
- The **implementation (HTML, CSS, layout logic)** is done by me.
- The layout was further **improvised for responsiveness**, especially for mobile screens.

This is **not an exact 1:1 copy**, but a close recreation with my own technical approach and adjustments.

- Ensuring text, icons, and video scale properly
- Improving usability on mobile devices

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I practiced and improved:
